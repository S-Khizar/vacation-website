      <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119) ; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 15px;">The taxes & fees vary by resort but
        average $63 per night
        . That covers the regular taxes & fees plus as a cleaning fee that helps the resorts recover the cost of putting
        guests in a room (housekeeping, utilities, etc.). The majority of our resorts typically cost $125-250/night to
        book elsewhere</p>

        <b> A quick note on Hawaii:</b> We once again have resort options in Hawaii! However, all our Hawaii resorts
        currently
        do charge upgrade fees. Even after the upgrade fees, you'll typically save about 50% off booking the same
        resorts elsewhere. Our Hawaii resorts start at about $150/night (including all taxes, fees, & upgrade fees) for
        resorts that normally book at over $300/night total. Total savings for 7 nights on our Hawaii resorts typically
        range from $1,000 to $3,000.

      <h2 class="sph">SAVE $500 to $1500 OR GET A NEW VOUCHER ON US</h2>
      <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119) ; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 35px;">
        The majority of our resorts will save you from $500 to $1500 compared to booking the same resort, room, and
        dates elsewhere, but you may occasionally find options that only save a few hundred. In some cases, we've
        intentionally left those to give you more vacation options. In other cases, it's because we simply don't have
        the resources to stay on top of ever-changing resort prices. <b> So, if you book a resort and save anything less
          than $500, we'll send you a brand new voucher, on us, under our Savings Guarantee.</b>

        <p style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119) ; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 85px;">
          Remember, this offer’s made possible by helping resorts fill rooms that would’ve sat empty, so the resorts
          make available the weeks they know won't fill up. Many resorts make additional weeks available with upgrade
          fees. And some resorts only make weeks available with upgrade fees. Nearly all resorts have options to upgrade
          your room. Please note that these upgrades are 100% OPTIONAL. We make them available only to give you added
          flexibility. If you do opt for an upgrade, our Savings Guarantee still applies: Save at least $500, or get a
          brand new voucher on us.

            Since this offer’s made possible by helping resorts fill rooms that would’ve sat empty, not all dates are
            available to book. Some resorts only make a week or two available at at time, while others have nearly every
            week of the year. <b> If you're unable or unwilling to be flexible with your travel dates, you should

            You'll get to choose from hundreds of resorts across many exciting destinations. But available resorts
            change regularly, and we can't guarantee a specific resort or city will be available. That said, certain
            areas like Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Europe always have resorts to choose
            from. <b> But if you need a very specific destination, you should probably pay full price to get exactly

          The more flexible you can be with your destination, the more options you'll have for travel dates. And the
          more flexible you are with travel dates, the more options you'll find for destinations. <b> We have
            thousands of resorts in our system, so there will be plenty to choose from. </b> But do keep in mind
          that these travel vouchers are best for those vacations where you can be flexible with your dates and
          destination. And remember that your voucher never expires, so you'll have all the time you need to plan
          that perfect vacation.

        <p>
          At least one traveler must be 21+ and have a major credit/debit card. That's it! Since there are no timeshare
          presentations, there are no income requirements or other hoops to jump through.

      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Nope! With our new in-house program, you no longer have to pay the taxes & cleaning fee before you can see
          available resorts & dates. Wohooo!!! Now you'll only pay the taxes & cleaning fee once you actually book your
          stay.

      <button class="accordion">Do I have to pre-select a destination?</button>

        <p>
          Not anymore! With our new in-house program, you can now see all resorts across all destinations along with
          their available dates. That's going to give you A LOT more flexibility to find something that's going to work.

      <button class="accordion">How many people can I bring?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          As many as the room you book is designed to sleep! You're no longer limited to just two adults and two small
          kids. With our new program, you're welcome to bring as many people as your booked room is designed to
          sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most resorts the basic room sleeps either 2 or 4 people. But most resorts also offer upgrades to larger
          rooms
          that sleep more. A few resorts even offer 3-bedroom suites that sleep as many as 10 people.

      <button class="accordion">Can I book less than 7 nights?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Most of our resorts only allow us to book specific 7-night blocks, but you're not required to stay all 7
          nights.
          However, if you plan to check in late, you should contact the resort in advance to make arrangements.<br>
          That said, there are a few resorts that allow us to book 3 or 5-night blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, please be aware that most of the resorts that offer shorter stays are upgrade resorts, so the total
          fees are going to be higher, but you can still expect to save at least 40-80% off usual prices for the same
          resort
          and dates.

      <button class="accordion">Are there any all-inclusive upgrades available?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Yes, currently we have 5 nights in Cancun or 4 nights in Cabo that has an all-inclusive upgrade option. The
          upgrade costs approximately $95/night/adult or $15/night/child depending on the season. You will need to
          choose
          Cancun or Cabo specifically.
